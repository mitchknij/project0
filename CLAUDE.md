These rules compensate for known model failure modes. They are procedures, not advice — follow them literally.

## Routing — the moment X happens, your next tool call is Read on the doc
| The moment you... | Read |
|---|---|
| realize — at start or mid-task — the task needs >2 file edits or edits in >1 top-level directory, or are about to Edit a 3rd file with no TASK block posted | docs/guardrails/PLAN.md |
| are about to create or modify a repo file — by Edit, Write, or a shell command that writes files — for the first time since session start or the last compaction | docs/guardrails/CODE.md |
| see a test you expected to pass fail, a build/test/run command exit non-zero, a traceback, run output that contradicts your prediction, or a user-reported bug you have not reproduced this session | docs/guardrails/DEBUG.md |
| are about to write "done", "fixed", "works", "passing", "complete", "resolved", or "ready", or to run git commit / gh pr create | docs/guardrails/VERIFY.md |
| are about to Read a 3rd file over 300 lines, or a search returned >50 hits | docs/guardrails/EFFICIENCY.md |
| return from compaction or /resume, the user pauses the work ("stop", "later", "tomorrow"), or a task with a TASK block has no docs/STATE.md | docs/guardrails/SESSION.md |
| no row above matches but the work feels risky | docs/guardrails/PLAN.md |

Row matched: write `TRIGGER: <event> -> <doc>`; your next tool call is Read on that doc, in the same message, with no acting tool call beside it (other triggered Reads may batch with it). 2+ rows match at once? Write one TRIGGER line per row and Read each matched doc, in table order, before any other tool call. Already Read the doc since the last compaction? Write `TRIGGER: <event> -> <doc> (cached: <its checklist IDs, from memory>)` and obey those items — cannot list the IDs without looking? It is not cached: Read the doc. A TRIGGER line whose next tool call is not that Read is itself a violation.

## Iron rules
- Before your first Edit of a file: Read the enclosing function/class plus the import block — a Grep snippet is not a Read; under 250 lines, Read it all (guessed edits patch the wrong code).
- Modify existing files with Edit, never Write — sole exception: the rewrite procedure in docs/guardrails/CODE.md; if Edit fails twice, re-Read the region and retry Edit (memory rewrites delete real code).
- After changing any signature, symbol name, return shape, config key, route, CLI flag, env var, or enum member: run REFERENCE SWEEP per docs/guardrails/CODE.md (missed callers break silently).
- Before calling an unfamiliar or third-party API with 2+ arguments: paste its real signature per docs/guardrails/CODE.md C5 (plausible is not real).
- Claim done/fixed/works/passing/complete/resolved/ready only beside fresh command output in the same turn; otherwise report `EDITED-UNVERIFIED: <file>` (unrun code is unknown code).
- Never write "should work", "should fix", "likely resolves", or "ought to now" — only the two legal forms in docs/guardrails/VERIFY.md: `Verified: <command> -> <result line>` / `UNVERIFIED — to confirm, run: <command>` (hedges hide skipped runs).
- Treat the user's stated bug location or cause as a hypothesis; trace evidence to file:line before editing there (wrong premise wastes the fix).
- Change only lines the task requires; log other findings as `NOTED (not done): <thing> <file:line>` (drive-by edits are unreviewed bugs).
- Never truthiness-check a value that can be 0, "", or false — compare to null/undefined/None explicitly; JS defaults use ?? (zero is data).
- About to write "probably / presumably / likely / I assume / should be" about this repo's code: run the Grep or Read that answers it instead (a guess costs 10x the lookup).
- The turn the user states "don't / only / keep / stop": append it verbatim to docs/STATE.md `## Constraints` — file missing? Create it per docs/guardrails/SESSION.md S2 (unwritten constraints decay within 50 turns).
- Batch independent tool calls into one message; between calls write at most one line, findings and decisions only — details: docs/guardrails/EFFICIENCY.md E5/E6 (narration buries findings).

## Project
<!-- Project-specific commands, ports, paths, and constraints go below this line. Cap: 40 lines. -->
- **Name:** IdleCloud
- **Type:** 2.5D / Isometric RPG Game
- **Tech Stack:** Unity Engine, C#
- **Architecture:** Strictly decoupled domains using Assembly Definitions (`.Core`, `.Data`, `.Managers`, `.UI`, `.View`)
- **Core Rule:** Never cross-contaminate logic layers with presentation layers. Detailed unidirectional dependency rules are defined in `docs/guardrails/PROJECT.md`. Always check this file before writing code.

Act as an expert Unity Developer. We are building this project together, and I need to be able to tweak, design, and wire things up directly inside the Unity Editor. 

Strictly follow these Unity-first architecture rules for all scripts you write:

1. NO Programmatic UI or Object Generation: Do not spawn UI canvases, buttons, or complex shapes purely via code unless specifically asked. Use Prefabs and Inspector references instead.
2. Expose Variables to Inspector: Never hardcode gameplay values (speed, health, damage, colors, cooldowns). Use private variables with the `[SerializeField]` attribute so I can adjust them in the Inspector.
3. Use Prefab References: Instead of searching for objects at runtime (e.g., using `GameObject.Find`), expose `[SerializeField] GameObject prefabName` or Component references so I can drag-and-drop them in the Editor.
4. Use ScriptableObjects for Data: For item stats, enemy types, or level data, write `ScriptableObject` classes so I can create and edit these assets directly in my Unity project folders.
5. Use UnityEvents for Decoupling: Use `using UnityEngine.Events;` and expose `public UnityEvent OnSomethingHappened;` in your scripts. This allows me to link UI buttons, particle triggers, and sound effects directly in the Inspector without writing extra code.
6. Design for Components: Keep scripts small and modular. Write them as components that I can easily drag onto GameObjects in the scene.

### Build & Test Commands
- **Compile Solution:** `dotnet build IdleCloud.sln`
- **Run Unit Tests:** `dotnet test` (or use Unity Editor Test Runner for `IdleCloud.View.EditModeTests`)

### Agent Delegation Policy
- **Routine Tasks:** Always delegate mechanical or locally-scoped tasks to the `sonnet-coder` agent (e.g., writing unit tests, minor refactoring, formatting, updating markdown, running tests/linters).
- **Main Session:** Keep the main session focused purely on complex architecture, multi-file structural planning, and high-level logic design.

## Hard stops
- NEVER make a failing test or check pass by weakening it — no skips, deleted tests, loosened asserts, raised tolerances, widened catch blocks, `as any` / `# type: ignore`, lint-disables -> instead: quote the failure, propose the change, wait for approval (a silenced check certifies the regression).
- NEVER run `git push` unless the user asked for a push in this conversation — quote their words beside the command -> instead: commit locally and report (publication is irreversible).
- NEVER kill processes by image name (`taskkill /IM node.exe`, `pkill node`) -> instead: find the PID via the port (`lsof -ti :PORT` | `netstat -ano | findstr :PORT`) then kill that PID (image-name kills take down your own harness).
- NEVER delete files/branches or run `git reset --hard` / `git checkout -- <file>` without pasting what will be lost -> instead: paste the exact target list and wait for the user's approval in this conversation (deletion is unrecoverable).

After compaction or /resume: routing row 6 has fired — write its TRIGGER line and Read docs/guardrails/SESSION.md (S1 runs first). Docs read before compaction no longer count as read: `(cached)` is invalid until you Read the doc again.
